# DAGWS: Sequence algorithms lectures

Slides and exercises from sequence algorithms lectures I gave for the data analysis in genomics (DAG) workshop.

Parts of these lectures were inspired by Ben Langmead's computational genomics classes: https://github.com/BenLangmead/comp-genomics-class

## Structure 

The course is split into 4 thematic lectures. Each lecture has an associated jupyter notebook containing exercises in python. The anwers are missing from the notebooks, but each exercise session has a separate notebook in the same folder with answers added.

I: Introduction to sequence algorithms \[[slides](slides/seq_algos_1_intro.pdf) | [exercises](exercises/notebook_session1.ipynb)\]

  * Algorithms basics
  * Time complexity
  * Data structures
  * Hashing

II: Sequence alignments \[[slides](slides/seq_algos_2_seq_align.pdf) | [exercises](exercises/notebook_session2.ipynb)\]

  * Exact matching
    - naive
    - suffix arrays and trees
    
  * Inexact matching
    - Dynamic programming
 
III: Computational models in genomics \[[slides](slides/seq_algos_3_ml.pdf) | [exercises](exercises/notebook_session3.ipynb)\]

  * Markov models and HMM
  * Classification problem
    - Tree-based models
    - Intro to machine learning
 
IV: Network analysis \[[slides](slides/seq_algos_4_markov_graphs.pdf) | [exercises](exercises/notebook_session4.ipynb)\]

  * Graph representations
  * Graph traversal
  * Network clustering
